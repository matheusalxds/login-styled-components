> ### [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs)
> Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript)
> and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you
> to write actual CSS code to style your components.
> It also removes the mapping between components and
> styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling
> construct could not be easier!
>
> Additional:
> - Simple and cleaner code.
> - Different themes (Light and Dracula instead Dark theme. I really love Dracula's color pallet).
> - Animations.
> - Media Queries.
> - Reuse code.

> ### [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
> Why should we use Eslint?
> 
> Code linting is a type of static analysis that is frequently
> used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn't adhere
> to certain style guidelines.

> ### [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
> Why should we use Prettier?
> - You press save and code is formatted.
> - No need to discuss style in code review.
> - Saves you time and energy.
